# We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

# I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

# Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.

# You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results (-1, 1, or 0):

# The guess API is already defined for you.
# @param num, your guess
# @return -1 if my number is lower, 1 if my number is higher, otherwise return 0
# def guess(num):
